# AntennaPod without rewinds

This is an unofficial *fork* of the AntennaPod podcasting app for Android. Please see [here](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod) for the official repository.

The only purpose of the fork is to disable the automatic rewinding of the episode after pausing for a minute. It has previously been made clear that providing user-configurable options for this feature is not desireable since the default works well for 99% of people. The fork exists because I am in the 1% for whom this behavior is not suitable.

AntennaPod is a great app and I highly recommend getting the official version on F-Droid if automatic rewinding is not an issue for you!
